# Better Sweater

I love wearing sweaters, however, I don't like scrolling online to find sweaters that I like. So, I'm attempting to automate it.

I put together a data set of ~1000 sweaters and trained them to (somewhat successfully) tell the difference between sweaters I like and don't like via Tensonflow. I'm also building a simple React app so a user can take or upload photos and learn if I'll like a given sweater.

I might implement some webscraping so it can find sweaters for purchase, but that may be a future project.
